        <h3>Silvana Koch-Mehrin
     		MEP</h3>
        <p dir="ltr">“Karen moderated a high level political seminar for us on the topic of the EU’s investment protection policy. From the planning stages of the seminar to the introduction of the panelists, to chairing the debate, but also intervening when necessary – we felt in good hands with Karen and can recommend her to anyone who is looking for an experienced moderator for their events”.</p>

        <p>“We have used Andrea as a Moderator for two years now at the European Employment Forum. She has dealt with senior panellists firmly and fairly and from a Conference organisers view point is pro-active prior to the event and runs the session to time. Hope to use her in the future”.</p>

        <h3>Tom Arnold
            CEO Concern Worldwide</h3>
        <p>An event can be badly compromised by participants who speak too long and run way over time. Awkward situations can also arise if audience members are difficult to control and try to take over an event. Our moderators can adeptly handle these kind of awkward situations. Participants who run over time will be diplomatically requested to finish and tricky audience members can be politely but firmly handled.</p>

            Directorate for Communication, Press and 
			Events EU Committee of the Regions</h3>
        <p>“We had the pleasure to work with Karen Coleman during the edition of EuroPCom, the European Conference on Public 4th Communication, in October 2013. During the plenary sessions of the conference, she moderated the high-level debates with political leaders and senior experts in a most professional and well-balanced way. We are looking forward to inviting her again in the near future”.</p>

        <h3>Ambassador Peter Gunning
            Permanent Representative of Ireland of the
            Council of Europe</h3>
		<p>“Karen Coleman did an outstanding job of moderating our high-level political round-table in Strasbourg in April 2013, jointly organised by the Irish Representations to the Council of Europe and the European Union, which focussed on the economic crisis and democratic accountability within the EU. From the start, she set an accessible yet focused tone for the discussion, encouraging audience involvement and helping to spark a dynamic discussion. Her in-depth knowledge of EU affairs, together with the rapport she quickly generated with both the panellists and the audience, helped ensure it was a successful event. We would highly recommend Planet Podium for any similar such engagements.”</p>

		<p>“I would like to write to you to thank you for your contribution to the success of the 14th International Anti-Corruption Conference this past week in Bangkok.

		<p>“Karen successfully co-moderated our 2013 European Policy Summit “Saving Europe’s ‘Lost Generation” with our Secretary General, Giles Merritt. Karen exuded professionalism from the moment we contacted her, and was very thorough in understanding our needs and expectations. She kept the discussion on track and well-balanced and made sure the attendees who wanted to ask questions were called upon and that their questions were relevant. We would not hesitate to ask Karen to moderate another event and look forward to working with her again”.</p>
